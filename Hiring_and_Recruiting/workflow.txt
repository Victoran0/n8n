Upon submission of the Application typeform form, candidates with over 1 year of experience that have included a portfolio in their application get their data sent to the Shortlisted Table of the Airtable project. The ones who have less than 1 year experience or do not have a portfolio are sent to the Not Qualified table of the AIrtable project.
A human-in-the-loop (HR) who takes care of the Airtable project can view the Shortlisted table, assess candidates' portfolio and other fields and if they are fit for the position, the candidate's status will be changed from Shortlisted to invite for Interview.
Once the status field is updated, the truthy part of the "status is changed to invite for interview" node fires and an interview email is sent to the candidate with a link for booking. After that, the candidate's mail status will be updated to Interview Mail Sent. 
After the interview, the HR can change the status from "invite for interview" to "interviewed". After assessing the interviewed Applicants, the selected Candidates will have their status changed to "Hired" and non Selected Candidates will have their status changed to "Rejected". Either of these changes will trigger the second workflow and an email will be sent to the candidates in any of the cases. However, when a candidate is not qualified, their data will be deleted from the Shortlisted table and appended to the Candidate Pool table for future consideration.
