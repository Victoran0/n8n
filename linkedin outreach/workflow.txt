On submitting an n8n form containing details about desired new LinkedIn connections, the workflow is triggered. A search URL is then generated for Apollo using the output from the form submission, done by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite. This Apollo URL is then ran on APIFY actor and at least 300-500 results are gotten. The limit node can limit the result in order to continue with to a particular number of profiles. Based on the user's experience and activities gotten from the Apify result, a personalized Icebreaker is then generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite and each profile name, linkedin URL, current job title and icebreaker is sent to Google Sheets for record purpose. The aggregate node then aggregates the data of the desired linkedin profiles which are then sent to a PhantomBuster Phantom and its Launch is triggered. After waiting for the Phantom's execution to be complete, its result data is then fetched, and an HTTP request is sent to get the csv file of the launch result. The time the connection request was sent to each profile is then appended to the "Connected At" column in the connections sheet.
